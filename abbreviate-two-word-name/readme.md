The purpose of this problem is to write a function that takes in a string containing a two word name as a parameter, then returning a string with the abbreviation of the first letter of the first name, a period, and the first letter of the last name. The abbreviated letters should be in upper case.

I completed the whiteboard portion of the assignment with Catherine.
