# Sum of Odd Cubed Numbers
https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-odd-cubed-numbers/train/javascript

In this kata, we wrote a function that took in an array of numbers and/or non-numbers and returned the sum of the cube of all of the odd numbers. If any non-number elements were present, then we returned undefined.
